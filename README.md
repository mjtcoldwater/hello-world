# hello-world
This is my absolute beginner repository. My immediate aim is simply to try to learn to read, then write, Python 2.7
I am attempting to learn both by doing the Codecademy Python course, and also by going through the Learn Python the Hard Way excercises. I'm pretty sure there are plenty of other Github newbies who end up here in the same way. I should say, however, that I am righteously excited by the prospect not just of getting to know Python, but also extending it to numPy and Pandas so that I can make the transition from excel to these languages.
